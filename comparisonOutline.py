This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (4 == 4)
print(d) 

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

r =(2 == 3)
print(r)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

c = (4 > 3)
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b = (4 < 3)
print(b)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = 2
x = 3

h = (x >= y)
print(h)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y = 5
x = 3

g = (x <= y)
print(g)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

# misspelling variables
# missing the operator
# missing the variable/data
