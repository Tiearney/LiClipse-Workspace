#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 3
print (a)

a = 2
print (a)

a = 1
print (a)

#Float

a = 3.45

a = 5.43


a = 4.32
 
#String

a = "Samantha"

a = "Michael"

a = "Adrien"

a = "Samantha and Michael"

#Boolean

#List

a = ["Sam", "Michael", "Adrien"]

a = [True, False, True]

a = [3.2, 4.5, 5.8]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

var = 4
var = "string"

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

varTwo = var
print(varTwo)

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

b = [a, varA, var]
print(b)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

list = ["a", "b", "c"]
print(list[2])

listVar = list[0]
print(listVar)

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

string = "Samantha"
print(string[0])

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print("string")

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
