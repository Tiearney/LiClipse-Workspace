'''The objective is to convert the number of miles to yards, feet, and inches'''

#Use input() to get the number of miles from the user. And store
#that int in a variable called miles.

print(inch)
#Convert miles to yards, using the following:
# 1 mile = 1760 yards.

print(str(miles) + " miles converts to " + str(yards) + " yards ")

#Store the value in a variable called yards and print it out with a 
#simple statement.

print(" This is how many yards are in a mile : " + str(yards) + " yd ")

#Convert miles to feet, using the following:
# 1 mile = 5280 feet.

#Store the value in a variable called feet and print it out with a 
#simple statement.
