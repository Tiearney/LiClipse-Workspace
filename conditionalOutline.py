#1) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if statement, and if a is more than
#5, print out "a is more than 5."

a = 7

if a>5:
    print("a is more than 5")

#2) Make a boolean variable named b. Now make an if statement, and if b is True
#print out "b is True."

b = 8
if b==8: 
    print("b is True")

#3) Make an int variable named c. Now make an if/elif statement, and if c is 
#more than 0, print "c is positive". Else if c is less than 0, print "c is
#negative".

c = 12
if c >= 12: 
    print("c is positive")

else:
    print("c is negative")

#4) Make an int variable named d. Now make an if/elif/else statement, and if 
#d is more than 0, print "d is positive". Else if d is less than 0, print "c is
#negative". Else, print "d is zero".

d = -10

if d <= -10:
    print("d is positive")
    
else: 
    print("d is negative")

#5) Make an if statement with any comparison, with a common SYNTAX error.

#missing the if/elif/else
