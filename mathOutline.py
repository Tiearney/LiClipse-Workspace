#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
y = "your" + "name"
print(y)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 + 4 
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
x = 4 - 4
print(x)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
s = 4.32 - 5.6 
print(s)
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
w = 6 * 3 
print(w)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.
n = "Tiearney" * 3
print(n)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
h = 10/5
print(h)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
a = 12.5/6.2 
print(a)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
e = 4 % 4
print(e)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.
q = 5 // 4
print(q)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 4 ** 4
print(g)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

# misspelling variables
# missing a variable
# missing a operator
